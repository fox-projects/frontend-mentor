# frontend-mentor

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/hyperupcall) is a site that provides website challenges aimed to improve web development skills. This repository houses my solutions to the challenges.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hyperupcall/frontend-mentor
cd frontend-mentor
```

Recommend installing extensions such as [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), [Stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint) [axe Accessibility Linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deque-systems.vscode-axe-linter)

There are some things to note:

- I use newer APIs such as CSS Typed OM and CSS Nested Properties. The former is not available in Firefox and the latter is only available (without flags) since Firefox 117 and Opera 100.
- I went for Parcel as my bundler and the usual EditorConfig/Prettier setup in addition to Stylelint.
