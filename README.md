# frontend-mentor

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/hyperupcall) is a site that provides website challenges aimed to improve web development skills.

There are some things to note:

- I use newer APIs such as CSS Typed OM and CSS Nested Properties. The former is not available in Firefox and the latter is only available (without flags) since Firefox 117 and Opera 100.
- I went for Parcel as my bundler and the usual EditorConfig/Prettier setup in addition to Stylelint.
